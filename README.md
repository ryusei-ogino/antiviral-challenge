Ensemble docking and visual inspection

1. Search SARS and MERS holo structure from pdb database
```


```
2. Calculate the similarity of test compounds with the compound containing in holo structure
```


```
3. Clustering the test compounds with the similarity
```


```
4. Choose receptors based on the similarity in each cluster
```


```
5. Docking with glide
```


```
6. Visual inspection
```


```
7. (If the criteria are not met) Reselect receptors and docking
```


```
